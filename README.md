# Test Assignment 1
## Reflections
### Shooting
	A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List
	the possible reasons for the man not dying.

#### GUN-RELATED
	* The gun was a toy or water gun.
	* The caliber was too small to do fatal damage.
	* The gun fired a "shot", meaning an alcoholic drink.
#### SHOOTER-RELATED
	* She missed completely.
	* She missed any vitals.
	* She failed to account for the wind as she was not trained to fire a sniper rifle
		over long distances.
#### VICTIM-RELATED
	* He was wearing body armor.
	* Somebody took the shot for him.
	* The victim precisely fired a counter-shot directly at the bullet.
#### SCENARIO-RELATED
	* It was a fictional scenario created for an assignment and thus nothing about it was real.
	* The man was only a reflection.
	* Everything was symbolic.
	* It was only in a game.
	* Getting hit did not deplete his health points.
	* He was rolling, so he still had a few invulnerability frames left.
	
### Alien
	An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume
	that the alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it
	needs a clear step-by-step instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as
	you can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap
	anti-clockwise)
	
	PREPARATION
	* If the alien has eyes, assume that it can learn by watching and
		demonstrate by brushing my own teeth.
	* If the alien does not speak a language I know, teach it one.
	* Acquire toothbrush and toothpaste.
	INSTRUCTIONS
	1. Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap
		anti-clockwise with the fingers of your right hand. 
		Be careful not to squeeze the toothpaste out yet.
		When the cap is off the tube, place it nearby rather than holding on to it.
	2. Hold the toothbrush in your right hand with the brush part facing up towards
		the opening of the tube of toothpaste whose opening you hold facing down towards the toothbrush.
	3. Gently squeeze the toothpaste until an amount of toothpaste the size of 
		an average pea has left the tube. Place the tube close to the cap. 
		Keep the toothbrush in the same position for now.
	4. OPTIONAL STEP.
		Depending on the type of water faucet, apply a small amount of water on the toothpaste by:
		a. triggering a movement sensor to release (cold) water by moving your left hand in front of the sensor.
		b. turning the blue handle of the faucet to release cold water.
			Do this by testing the direction needed to release water first.
		
		When a flow of water has been achieved, move the toothbrush with the toothpaste
			facing up under the flow of water without hitting any surface and move it back out 
			within the required time interval of a second or two.
			A second is the time it takes for the long arm of an analog clock to move 1/60th of a full rotation.
		
		c. Turn off the water flow by no longer triggering the movement sensor or moving the handle back to its original position
			with your left hand.
	5. Maneuver your facial muscles to uncover your teeth and then rotate the toothbrush to have the toothpaste on the brush face your teeth as you bring
		the toothbrush close to your teeth.
	6. 	Do step a. and b. for about 20 seconds each and attempt not to swallow any toothpaste.
		a. Gently, without causing pain, press the brush up against your teeth and maneuver the toothbrush such that it approximates a circular movement
		over the outward-facing surfaces of all your teeth.
		b. Gently repeat the same maneuver for the other teeth surfaces.
	7. Spit out the toothpaste remaining in your mouth into the sink. This can be done by washing it out with water at a comfortable temperature for you.
	8. Turn off the faucet if it's on. Place the toothbrush back where you found it.
	9. OPTIONAL STEP: Admire your freshly brushed teeth by appraising their reflection in a mirror!

## Thoughts on TDD
* What was positive and good about using TDD?
<br>I like the idea of having my software be tested, which it always will be using TDD.
* What was annoying or difficult?
<br>It's difficult to adhere to TDD and not just jump ahead to the "optimal solution" immediately, if you have had some thoughts on how to implement something.
* What surprised you?
<br>I was surprised by how naturally the process went once I got into it. It made sense that you logically end up accounting for what your tests are missing as you write the tests.
* Did TDD help you write some you wouldn't otherwise have thought of?
<br>Possibly, not sure yet - need to spend more time on it.
